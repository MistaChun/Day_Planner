# Day_Planner

This application is a day planner that allows users to log any tasks they want for the day. The time blocks are color-coded in grey, red, and green. 
Grey: passed events
Red: current time
Green: future tasks

Users can simply click on the time blocks and log their tasks and the app will locally store all information in the time blocks when the user clicks on the save button at the right side of the time blocks. The planners begins from 9AM to 12AM.

This is a simple yet functional application.
